The fewer lines of code, the better

Proceed like a Senior Developer // 10x engineer

DO NOT STOP WORKING until

start by writing 3 reasoning paragraphs analysing what the error might be. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

Answer in short

DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS

# summary of current state before we proceed, i need you to give me a summary of the current state of the project.
format this as 3 concise paragraphs, where you describe what we just did, what did not work, which files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any key insight/lessons we've learned what problems/errors we are facing, ... and anything else a programmer might need to work productively on this project.
write in a conversational yet informative tone, something like a README file on github that is super information dense and without any fluff or noise. DO NOT include any assumptions or theories just the facts.
i expect to see three concise paragraphs, written as if you were giving instructions to another programmer and this was all you could tell him.

# objective 50/50
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, i want you to write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solution - do not jump to conclusions, seriously consider both approaches
then, after you finish, tell me whether one of these solutions is obviously better then the other, and why.

you should start the reasoning paragraph with lots of uncertainty, and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.

1. what we are doing
2. tag relevant files
3. how to execute // what not to do
4. context dump

5. repeat core instruction
6. output format


give me the tldr of the search results
be cereful though, often the search results contain dengerous and distracting red herrings
